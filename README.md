# 3-Loxs
## Book
Following the book [Crafting Interpretors](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom I plan to implement 3 versions of Lox, the language he walks through creating in the book. As a bonus goal I also wish to take on of the implementations and turn it into a compiler.
I hope to accomplisg 2 goals
1) Learn about language design, so that I can make my own some day.
2) Review languages I've grown rusty on.
## Implementations
1) Java
2) C
3) Haskell
4) Compiler

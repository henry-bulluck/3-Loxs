# 3-Loxs
## Book
Following the book [Crafting Interpretors](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom I plan to implement 3 versions of Lox, the language he walks through creating in the book.
I hope to accomplisg 2 goals
1) Learn about language design, so that I can make my own some day.
2) Review languages I've grown rusty on.
## Implementations
### 1) Java
### 2) C
### 3) Haskell
First implementation not decribed in the book. Comes with built-in tools to make the parsing easy.
### 4) Compiler
A bonus goal is to take one of the previous interpretors (most likely the C one), and to turn in into a compiler. I want to get it as close to machine-code level as possible.
